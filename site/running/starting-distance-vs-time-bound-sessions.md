# Distance-bound vs Time-bound sessions

At the beginning [phase 0](phase0.html), I made a small but important mistake:  
I bound my sessions to **distance** instead of **time**.

That meant:

- Same route
- Same distance
- Try to complete it every session

It felt logical: predictable, repetitive and comfortable, but it was the wrong choice for this stage.

## Distance-bound sessions

**What it looks like**

- Fixed route
- Fixed distance
- Session ends when the distance is completed

**When it makes sense**

- When fitness is stable
- When pace is predictable
- When recovery is reliable
- When training goals are performance-oriented

**Problems at this stage**

- Bad days feel like failure
- Fatigue or poor sleep immediately show up as “slowness” and extra time on feet
- Heart rate control becomes harder
- Sessions quietly turn into effort tests

Early on, distance turns _variability_ into _pressure_.

## Time-bound sessions

**What it looks like**

- Fixed duration (e.g. 30–33 minutes)
- Distance varies naturally
- Session ends when time is up

**Why it works better early**

- Effort stays bounded
- Heart rate is easier to control
- Progress shows up naturally as longer distance
- Bad days are still valid sessions

Time-bound sessions make it easier to:

- Show up consistently
- Stay calm
- Avoid turning every run into a benchmark

## What I changed

I switched to:

- Fixed time
- Same route
- Let distance increase on its own

Nothing else changed.

The sessions immediately felt:

- More predictable
- Less mentally demanding
- Easier to repeat day after day

---

## Rule of thumb (for me)

- **Early phases → time-bound**
- **Later phases → distance-bound**
- If motivation or recovery is fragile, default to time

At this stage, I’m not training distance.  
I’m training _showing up_.
