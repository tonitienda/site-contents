# AidiaHub

**AidiaHub** is a space for sharing and discovering ideas — some wild, some thoughtful, some brilliant, and many just waiting for the right person to make them real.

I created AidiaHub because I’ve always been surrounded by ideas — some I pursued, others I let go. I wanted a place where people could *release* the ideas they don’t plan to build themselves, and *explore* what others have in mind. Maybe for inspiration, maybe for collaboration, or maybe just for fun.

As an indie developer, I built this to scratch my own itch: to offload ideas I couldn’t get to, and to get inspired by what others are thinking about. The platform lets users:
- Share ideas publicly (even the silly or incomplete ones)
- React to and save ideas they like
- Bookmark and track what inspired them
- (Coming soon) Collaborate and build ideas together

It’s a lightweight, community-driven project — no big company or investors behind it — just me, trying to build something useful, simple, and fun.

If you’ve ever said “someone should build this,” AidiaHub is for you.
