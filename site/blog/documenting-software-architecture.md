# Documenting Software Architecture 

## Formal Documentation 

(UML, SySML, etc)

## Pragmatic documentation 

### Focus on target reader

### Prioritize for readability 

legends + combination of views

happy path in detailed combined view, error handling in specific sequence diagrams if needed.

### Snapshot with current state

not far future, not past 

use ADR/RFC for that. (link to another post)
