# Document Architecture Decisions

## Why document decisions 

drive the decision itself

reason about future decisions in the same areas

document rational of decisions behind the current state of the architecture 

## ADRs and RFCs

list differences if any


## Rules

## Advice

write options also the not considered

write pros and cons of all options as if you want to take them and then another round as of you want to discard. Be objective and picky specially with the one you want to propose.


ask for opinion on experts you know and anyone that might provide more pros / cons (or remove rfem)

link to related ADRs. specially the one this ADR might be replacing and once accented and planned to implement (or during the implementation,) update the architecture document and remove the discarded ADRs and add this one 

this way people can navigate from arch doc to current adr and also back in time to related adrs
